Hi,

I am Marvon Adams, from South Africa but has worked in the middle east as a conflict corespondent for the past 4 years, with over a decade in the media industry i have developed a keen interest in big data, so what i have done is explore data journalism but see myself more as a social entrepreneur that can make money for the greater good.

I am a 31 years old, who is trying to leave the world a better place. In South Africa we have a pandemic that isnt covid but rather Gender Base Violence, for the past decade this sort of information was only released by the South African Police Service annual but this isnt the most reliable data. So, the government has taken the direction of sorting out the problem but how can we if there isnt accurate data so we know what exlactly the extend of the problem. 

Que, A luta continua.

A visionary, driven and problem solver are some of the traits to describe my character. I walk in intrigrity and speak truth to power.

I have no experience in coding and would appreciate edvice or even hep cause i am [ part of a challenge that current takes place with only a few weeks left to get a working app, so please do consider.

I started the company about 3 years back and since than i have done multi pilot projects in South Africa and deveoloped partnerships with expertise across the world which includes India, Isreal and South Africa.

I am keen to meet like minded coders, developers and even social entrepreneurs. This path of entrepreneurship is a lonely road and i realise that its a struggle but i am gluided by the fact that i would like to make this world a better place.
